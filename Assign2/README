1. Sort.c/ sort : There are no errors and every thing works as intended. 

2. grep using cs308a2_grep_data_1 file works as intended and there are no errors. However, for a with more 
than 1 number matched, will only be counted once. i.e

744509763 400011959 1440466707

here 44 would only be counted once.

3. grep using cs308a2_grep_data_2 file, here the program doesn't finish running because of the following:
    
 (i) The way grep works is such that it matches strings as the parent pushes the data to the child's In pipe.
This would be great if the data wasn't much but in this case the data is too much that when grep tries to push data out to child's pipe out,
the pipe fill up causing grep , child to block. 

 (ii) While child is in block as the pipe is full and the parent keeps sending data to child for grep, eventually the parent also blocks causing a
deadlock to occur. Hence Ctrl XC to exit the process.  

Summary: This file fails because it has a lot of data which cause the pipe[1] to fill up leading the child and parent to block causing a deadlock.
